Worked last night with Josh Northey from 1745-0545. Got to participate in his first STEMI ever! Was a great call. Night was mostly all great calls where patients were at leats actually sick; only had one patient that was a complete waste of time, she called to transport to L&D because her home BP machine read 155 systolic. First call was a lady with lumbar spinal stenosis who hurt her back while helping family move, we had to give her entonox in order to move her to the stair chair and out of the apartment. Then we picked up the STEMI in Hampton Village who had chest pain on and off all day, he was diaphoretic and clammy when we got to him and his 4-Lead showed T-wave inversion in Lead I. He had a massive anterior STEMI on 12-lead and we did the ol' load and go to RUH - he ended up in cath lab. Then we picked up a psych patient who called in for diabetic problems - she hadn't taken her insulin all day and is supposed to take 16U * 3 doses; instead, she took all 48U of her rapid acting insulin at midnight and called us when her sugars dropped. Her apartment was disgusting and had litter everywhere, cat litter spilled on the floor, dirty clothes, half eaten food and cat droppings strewn around. Final call of the night was an old man who had fallen while using the bathroom and had soiled himself pretty well throughout with feces. We had to change and clean him and transport; he was quite fevered with a rectal temp of 38.4C as recorded by saint paul's.
